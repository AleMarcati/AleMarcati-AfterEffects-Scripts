# AleMarcati's After Effects Scripts
A few After Effects scripts I've written that might be useful for other people too. Feel free to download, alter and distribute.

# [Keep Moving](https://github.com/AleMarcati/AleMarcati-AfterEffects-Scripts/blob/main/AleMarcati_KeepMoving_V2.jsx):
Adds (to selected layers) expressions that generate a constant motion (position, rotation or scale motion). It adds a Null layer with a slider that controls the speed of each type of motion.

# [Comp Renamer](https://github.com/AleMarcati/AleMarcati-AfterEffects-Scripts/blob/main/AleMarcati_CompRenamer.jsx):
Useful for batch-renaming multiple compositions (and other project items like folders and footage), replacing one character sequence with another.

# [Auto Slicer](https://github.com/AleMarcati/AleMarcati-AfterEffects-Scripts/blob/main/AleMarcati_AutoSlicer_V1.jsx):
Takes a composition with multiple solid layers in it and slices it into compositions the size of each solid, then places the original composition inside the smaller compositions positioning so the respective solid is perfectly framed. Useful for creating multi-screen pixelmaps.
