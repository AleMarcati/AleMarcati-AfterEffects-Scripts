# AleMarcati-AfterEffects-Scripts
A few After Effects scripts I've written that might be useful for other people too. Feel free to download, alter and distribute.

[Keep Moving](https://github.com/AleMarcati/AleMarcati-AfterEffects-Scripts/blob/main/AleMarcati_KeepMoving_V2.jsx):
Adds expressions to the selected layers that generate a constant motion. Also adds a Null layer with a slider that controls the speed of the motion. The user can set it to affect position, rotation or scale.
